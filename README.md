Common shell utilities I find useful/handy to have around

## Structure
commands find in the  [lib](./lib) subfolder contain useful functions 
and should be sourced, rather than invoked directly

commands in the [bin](./bin) folder are meant to be executed directly

## Compatibility
I mainly deal with `bash` and `zsh`, therefore the scripts are mostly
compatible with those shells.
Similarly, I mostly work on linux, therefore most scripts rely on
the standard GNU stack, and may not be fully POSIX
compatible
